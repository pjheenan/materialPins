Create Material colour schemes from your favourite Pinterest images

This simple app will take images from Pinterest and turn them into a material design base theme for your
next app. It works by using the [Pinterest API](https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/getting-started/introduction/)
and the [Palette library](https://developer.android.com/tools/support-library/features.html#v7-palette) to
extract contrasting colours from the image, then use those colours to build a material design compliant theme.
